Motivation has been a big theme in my life. I like to call coffee liquid motivation, but I'm today I'm officially recognizing that this is not at all doing justice to the complicated concept of getting motivated.

## Don't seek motivation. Build discipline

As far back as I can recall being conscious about motivation, I've heard people say that one shouldn't seek motivation, but rather build discipline. And at first sight, that makes sense. Motivation comes and goes. Discipline is reliable. But unlike muscles, discipline cannot easily be trained. To build muscles, you need discipline. But to build discipline, you need discipline. Which you needed in the first place.

Discipline can grow, and you should seek to increase it at every possible opportunity. But those opportunities are tricky.

## Discipline is a topic for a different post

Even though it's not ideal, you can live off of motivation and self-imposed external factors like promised deadlines. It might not make you happy, but it keeps you going. Whatever strategy you're following though, it really helps to trick your mind every now and then.

### 'Abusing' deadlines is not necessarily wrong

Deadlines can be very motivating. Starting early and finishing a project on time is often presented as The Right way to approach a project. But some people simply don't want to function that way. I personally work best on projects when I 'should' be working on other ones. Ask yourself if you're happy with this added pressure, and if it has a significant negative effect on your mental state. If you like working this way better, and you don't miss deadlines often, then why would you force a different way of working on yourself?

### Question everything...

No one likes working on things that they don't see as valuable. So don't. I'm not saying "Do whatever you feel" but rather, investigate the purpose of a task, or discuss the task with the person that handed it to you. People tend to be reasonable.

### ...especially The System

But the reason that people listen to, doesn't always work very well with bureaucracy. Sometimes you're doing your very best working on personal development; writing blog posts; reading books; becoming the very best version of yourself, professionally and otherwise... And sometimes school asks you to describe your functioning in an international setting that doesn't even exist in the first place.
