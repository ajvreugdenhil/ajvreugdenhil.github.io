## Introduction

Everyone knows that you should use strong passwords. But even if you go through all the effort of replacing your weak ones, choosing what is strong and what is weak might not be intuitive.

I can't go around asking everyone to tell me their passwords so I can judge if they're good or not. So the best I can do is write a guide to avoid common mistakes.

## My mistakes

I know, I know. Cyber hygiene rule number one: Don't reuse passwords. I was very, very guilty.

## Don'ts

known ones (Summer2018!, Password, 123456789)

easily guessable ones (fikkie, maga2020!)

generatable ones (Zeewolde2000!)

first capital, end with '!'

## Do's

Use a password manager

For pc password, locker password, etc, diceware

## Risk appetite and being reasonable

## Conclusion
