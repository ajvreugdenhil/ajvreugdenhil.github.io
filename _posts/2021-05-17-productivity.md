In the past few months, I've been pretty conscious about my habits and productivity. I've made changes and mistakes. Since learning from other people's mistakes is the second best way to learn, I'd like to share my findings with you all. Many changes have been inspired by Better than Before by Gretchen Rubin. 10/10 would recommend.

## Time management, the lazy way

Let's start with the simplest changes. The theme here being 'you can only manage what you measure.' Looking back critically, I could not account for all the time I spent. That didn't matter when I had a good feeling about a week, and finished all the relevant deadlines, but it was very unsatisfying to not quite know why some weeks just didn't feel as productive as they could have. That's why I started to monitor my screen time with [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/). Not with the intention of policing myself on when I should or shouldn't be working, but rather to make myself aware of my behavior. I figured that the awareness would be enough to set in motion any changes that might be necessary.
And it did work. I'm still making peace with the fact that I don't spend nearly as many hours on school as I first thought. But it's great to look back at a week and see just how my time was *actually* spent. Both from a productivity perspective, and just because looking at graphs about my own life is really fun.

## I need a calculator to count my subprojects, help

Another tool I've been using is [Todoist](https://todoist.com). I've been using this for a little over half a year. Currently, it's not nearly as big a necessity as it was when I started using it. Last semester we had to define our own learning goals and projects to go along with them. That, along with extracurricular activities, required keeping track of a lot of different (sub)projects. This semester, we are subjected to a mindless daze of weekly deadlines set by the course again, so the value of Todoist in my life is mostly limited to my own side projects and other Responsibilities Of Adult Life.
Because managing my tasks in Todoist is so much more fun than actually doing them (It wouldn't be the first time I spend nearly 3 hours a week on it), I've thought a lot about optimizing my usage.

### Don't spend more time on managing a task than on doing it

I've already stated how much more fun it is to enter tasks into Todoist than it is to do them. Don't fall into this trap. I've tried a few different setups with fancy filters and categorizing in many, many ways. In the end, most of this did not help. I generally don't have more than 10 tasks planned for a day anyway. This easily fits into neat list, so having them in a few different lists based on priority, importance, and duration does not help.

### Think about what matters

I have settled on five labels for now. These are time_short, time_long, moscow_must, moscow_should, and moscow_could. The function of these labels is purely to make myself think about what the task will be like. Having these labels visible in the "Today" view gives an overview that's as concise as possible, while still having enough information. And I need this information because:

### I'm a strange fella

I learned from the book that I mentioned in the first paragraph that I function best when *I* choose what tasks to do. (I'm an Obliger/Rebel as Gretchen would call it.) This means that I don't like to go through my list of tasks and do them one by one. In that regard, I think I don't use my task list as most people would. I use my list to get an overview of what I should do, and then I do something else. I have more fun working on a side project on a saturday when I know there are still emails to be sent. I assume that this is because this makes the project seem more like a fun activity, because it contrasts with non-fun activities.

### The golden rule

When it comes to task management, I have one strong rule: no work on Sundays. This doesn't mean that I'm not allowed to exert more energy than half an apples worth, but it is limited by how I feel about a task. A great example was the fingerprint experiment from a few months ago. I started it on a sunday because it was fun, and without any pressure whatsoever. But the moment I decided that I wanted to add it to my school portfolio, it was off-limits because it had turned into work.
I have no intention of letting *the rule* determine *my life*, but the life I want does not include burnout, so that's why *I* stick to *the rule*.
