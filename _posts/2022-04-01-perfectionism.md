I've had trouble admitting to myself that I'm a perfectionist. That is, until earlier today when I realized "I'd rather have failed and be done with it, than be seen failing." This is highly irrational of course and I would like to get rid of this way of thinking.

There is no easy solution though. No neural patch. No behavioural hotfix. What we _can_ do is make changes in our routines. Try things out, see what sticks. The following are what I'm trying out.

## Eat The Frog

A slimy amphibian a day keeps the feelings of inadequacy away. Or not. The idea behind [ETF](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eat-the-frog) is to identify the one, single hardest task you have to do that day and do it first thing in the morning. I have been recommended ETF multiple times, but it's not for me.

## Highlight

Though the green croaker method is not for me, I can see its merits. We can modify it to be better suited for deadline workers like me. We still identify an ex-tadpole task, but all we do is highlight it. Be it with an actual highlighter on paper, or adding a tag in the task manager of choice. This is the task that has to be done by end of day.

With this approach we set a concrete deadline every day. This can be combined with a little extrinsic motivation. It still allows picking up arbitrary tasks that you'll make quickest progress on (within reason) while still being able to point to a successful task (or significant progress) every day.

## Intensity

As for momentum throughout the day, we have to be realistic. You can't work at your peak all day long. But it's not enough to just admit this. By actively categorizing tasks by how intensive they are, you can become more intentional in how you work and it will be easier to pick up on when you should be switching gears and picking a task that doesn't require all of your focus. I've chosen to categorize as low, medium and high intensity.

## 30/90 rule

One of the hardest changes to implement will be the 30/90 rule. Ask for feedback when you're 30% done and when you're 90% done. Incredibly simple but also incredibly hard as it goes against the perfectionistic tendencies we have been self-diagnosed with now.
